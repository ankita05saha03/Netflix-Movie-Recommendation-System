# Netflix Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system that uses content-based filtering to recommend movies and TV shows based on user input. The system is built using a Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and model training, and Flask to host a web application where users can explore the top movies and get personalized recommendations.

# Features

* Project Overview Page: Information about the project.
* Top Movies Page: Displays the top movies based on ratings.
* Recommendation Page: Users can input the name of a movie or TV show to receive personalized recommendations.

# Model and Techniques

The project employs content-based filtering for generating movie and TV show recommendations. The filtering process considers the content features of the movies and TV shows (e.g., genres, descriptions) to find similarities. Cosine similarity is used to find similar movies and TV shows based on these content features, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations.

# Results

The content-based filtering model, combined with cosine similarity, provides personalized recommendations based on user input.
